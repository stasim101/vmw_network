### Default Gateway in IP address

A default gateway is an IP address that is specified in a device to enable it to communicate with other devices that are not in the same network. Normally it is an address of the router interface that is connected to a network. The default gateway is always same as the IP address, the last byte or number is changed.

### SNAT - Source Network Address Translation

A Secure Network Address Translation (SNAT) is an object that maps the source client IP address in a request to a translation address defined on the BIG-IP device. A SNAT can be used by itself to pass traffic that is not destined for a virtual server. It  allows traffic from a private network to go out to the internet. The gateway has one arm on the public network and as part of SNAT, it replaces the source IP of the originating packet with its own public side IP.

      SNAT translates source IP addresses by replacing the IP address and port number of the internal network host to the external network address and port number of the deviceï¼Œ thereby hiding the internal IP addresses or sharing the limited IP addresses.
